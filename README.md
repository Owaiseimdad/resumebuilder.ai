# Getting started with a new weekend projects.
# First one here is resume builder, no template issues only one professional and one with pic and another is used by IIM graduates.

=> What is the reason to build this project? 
    I have read through multiple reddits and all the issues people face, and seems there is a certain gap
    in understanding what resume and why they should apply with it. The main focus of the application in start will
    be only for tech roles.
